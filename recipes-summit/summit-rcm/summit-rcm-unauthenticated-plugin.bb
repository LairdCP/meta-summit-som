SUMMARY = "Summit Remote Control Manager (RCM) Unauthenticated Plugin"
DESCRIPTION = "Add unauthenticated access support, for example, for factory \
reset and reboot endpoints. Due to security concerns, this \
should never be enabled unless requested by a customer, and \
preferably never enabled when Summit RCM is exposed on a \
public/external zone interface."
